        <br>Most of the items listed are either from <strong><span

        just like.
        <br><span style="color:red"><strong>This website is a demo & cannot be used to

            <span style="color: rgb(0, 128, 187)"><strong>However,</strong></span> most of the
            functionality you would find
            in a
            typical e-commerce website is here (except for actually delivering your order).
            The website itself was made using the <span style="color:rgb(110, 0, 212)">.NET</span> framework with
            <span style="color:red">Angular</span>.
            <span style="color:blue">PostgreSQL</span> is used for the database, and the website is hosted using
            <span style="color: rgb(0, 122, 163)">Digital Ocean</span>.

            <br><br>I did not want to buy a domain name for just a demo website. I am not made of money.
